### Reading: What is Metasploit? And how to use this popular hacking tool

------

Metasploit is a widely used penetration testing tool that makes hacking way easier than it used to be. It has become and indispensable tool for both red tead and blue team.

Metasploit is a penetration testing framework that makes hacking simple. I's an essential tool for many attackers and defenders. Point Metasploit at your target, pick and exploit, what payload to drop and hit Enter.

#### History of Metasploit

HD Moore began working on Metasploit in the early oughts, and released 1.0, written in Perl, in 2003. The project has grown dramatically since then, from the original 11 exploitds the project came with to more than 1,500 now, plus around 500 payloads, with a switch to Ruby under the hood along the way.

#### How to use Metasploit

During the information gathering phase of a pentest, Metasploit integrates seamlessly with Nmap, SNMP scanning and Windows patch enumeration, among others. There's even a bridge to Nessus. Every reconnaissance tool you can think of integrates with Metasploit.

Once the weakness is identified, hunt through Metasloit's large and extensible database for the exploit that will crack open that chink and get you in. 

Once on a target machine, Metasploit's quiver contains a full suite of post-exploitation tools, including privilege escalation, pass the hash, packet sniffing, screen capture, keyloggers, and pivoting tools. You can also set up a persitent backdoor in case the machine in question gets rebooted.
