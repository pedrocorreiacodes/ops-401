### Reading: What is Data Loss Prevention (DLP)?

------

Data loss preventin (DLP) is a set of **tools and processes** used to ensure that sensitive data is not loss, misused, or accessed bu anauthorized users. DLP sotware classifies regulated, confidential and business critical data and identifies violations of policies defined by regulatory compliance such ash HIPPA, PCI-DSS or GDPR.

  + What types of deployment architectures are offered?
  + Do they support Windows, Linux, and OS X wit feature parity?
  + What deployment options do they offer? Do they provide managed services?
  + Do you need to defend against mainly internal or external threats? Or both?
  + Do you need to perform content or context-bases inspection and classification? Will your users be able to self-classify documents?
  + Are you most concerned with protecting structured or unstructured data?
  + Do you plan to see and enforce data movement based on policies, events, or users?
  + What compliance regulations are you bound by? What new regulations are on the horizon?
  + Who are their technology alliance partners and what technologies would you like to integrate with your DLP?

#### Experts weigh in on data loss prevention

1. Data protection is everyone's job. "Everyone in a company is responsible for upholding data security standards. While the IT department does the majority of the everyday work with these systems and processes, stakeholders across your organization influence security policy and implementation".
2. Encryption is important. "Security is more than encryption, of course. But encryption is a critical component of security. While it's most invisible, you use strong encrption every day, and our Internet-laced world would be a far riskier place if you di not."
3. Be mindful of insider threats. Be proactive:
   1. Internal training for business users to feel responsible with knowledge, skill and awareness.
   2. Monitor activities that companies can employ that set up rules and parameters on what is considered appropriate for various employees to do as part of their work functions and flag instances that are outside of those rules.
