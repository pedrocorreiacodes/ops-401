## Class 42 Ethics In Tech

### Amazon Workers Demand Jeff Bezos Cancel Face Recognition Contracts With Law Enforcement

------

Back in 2018 and following employee protests at Google and Microsoft over government contracts, workers at Amazon cirulated an internal letter to CEO Jeff Bezos, asking him to stop selling the company's Rekognition facial recognition software to law enforcement and to boot the data-mining firm Palantir from its cloud services.

 The technology can recognize and track faces in real time, and the ACLU noted that such a powerful surveillance tool could easily be misused by law enforcement.

I tend to agree with the above statement, this kind of technology presents a high risk of being misused monitoring and opressing marginalized population. 

The employee letter clearly states my position:

*Our company should not be in the surveillance business; we should not be in the policing business; we should not be in the business of supporting those who monitor and oppress marginalized populations,” the employee letter states.*



### The ethical dilemmas of self-driving cars

------

Whom should the vehicle save – and whom should it harm – when an accident is unavoidable? A new dillema that the arrival of the self-driving car presents.

Who should the car harm if it finds itself in one of those unavoidable situations?

These are fundamental questions and according to Ford Motor Co. chairman Bill Ford "Nobody's talking about ethics", "If this technology is really going to serve society, then these kinds of issues have to be resolved, and resolved relatively soon."

According to the article Germany became the first country to attempt to answer such morbid questions with actual guidelines. The proposed rules state that self-driving cars should always attempt to minimize human death and shouldn't discriminate between individuals based on age, gender or any other factor. Human lives should also always be given priority over animals or property.

I believe that this dilema is transversal in several areas in technology, there needs to be a deep discussion in society in order to create ethical guidelines for all technology advances. Like we have a Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we should create basic standards of human behaviour, moral principles, to guide us through this new age of technology.
