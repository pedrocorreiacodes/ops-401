### Reading: What is Threat Hinting and Why Is It So Important?

------

Threat hunting is not responsive, it is proactive. We're going to see if our systems have some indicator of compromise.

The result we get is a compromise assessment.

+ Search the network for signs of compromise
+ Active/Proactive activity
  + Resuts driven
    + Target behaviour, not "signatures"
+ Should include all devices - Servers, desktops, network hardware, IIoT, BYOD
+ Output is a compomise assessment
  + Are any of our systems currently compromised?
