### Part 2: Investigating with Autopsy

------

#### Complete at least three different scenarios using Autopsy.

**Fat Volume Test Label #1**

1. Does the analysis tool display the volume label for the image? If so, what label does it give?

2. In the file browsing mode of the tool, is the "LABEL2" entry shown?  Can you view its contents?  What is its MD5?

### Part 3: Reporting

------

#### How can Autopsy accelerate your ability to find important data on a hard disk image?

Autopsy is a powerful tools. It allows to search by keywords, extract content and provides metadata for all the files such as MD5 hash value

#### Why might the Autopsy timeline view be relevant in an investigation?

Trough the timeline we can have an overview of the events that took place. What happend and when it happened. We can check when something as acessed, deleted and for how long.

#### How does Autopsy compare to manually searching a hard disk in something like Windows Explorer?

Through Autopsy we can serch for deleted files or hidden information in files such as images.
