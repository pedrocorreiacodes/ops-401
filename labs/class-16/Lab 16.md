### Part 4: Reporting

------

#### How did your testing go?

Everything went as expected.

#### Did you catch any misconfiguration and need to alter users or groups?

No.

#### Why is proper IAM important on the cloud?

IAM ensures control over which users have access to which applications / services. 

Having authentication and authorization mechanisms in a single platform allows consistency when managing user acess. In the case of someone leaving the company, that person's access rights may be immediately revoked, offering protection agains privilege creep attacks.
