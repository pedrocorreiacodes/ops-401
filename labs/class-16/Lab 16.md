### Part 2: Testing and Validation

------

#### Test and validate user permissions.

To test using the web portal got to **Identify and Access Management (IAM)**, **(Users)** and enable **Console password** for each user.

##### Sign in as each user using a new incognito (Chrome)/inPrivate (Firefox) window on your browser.

### Part 4: Reporting

------

#### How did your testing go?

Everything went as expected.

#### Did you catch any misconfiguration and need to alter users or groups?

No.

#### Why is proper IAM important on the cloud?

IAM ensures control over which users have access to which applications / services. 

Having authentication and authorization mechanisms in a single platform allows consistency when managing user acess. In the case of someone leaving the company, that person's access rights may be immediately revoked, offering protection agains privilege creep attacks.
