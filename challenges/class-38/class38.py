### In your own words, describe the purpose of this function as it relates to the overall objectives of the script ###

# This function will comb through your designated page ('url') and grab all the forms from the HTML content of a page (searching for the designate "form." We'll need this in prep for filling out any/all forms we encounter.) #

# This function submits the forms from the dictionary containing form details created by the function above (get_form_details) and populates the input fields with the strings contained in the variable 'value'. It constructs to full url if only a relative path is given. The form is submitted via get or post (dependant upon the form method). #

# Once given a url, this function grabs all the HTML forms and prints out the number of forms detected. It moves through each form, submitting with an insertion of Javascript (js_script)). If the Javascript is successfully passed and executed, the variable is_vulnerable is deemed True. The function will then return the vale of is_vulnerable to indicate whether or not the web page in question is, in fact, susceptible and vulnerable to XSS attacks. #

# Main

### In your own words, describe the purpose of this main as it relates to the overall objectives of the script ###


# "__name__" evaluates to the name of the current module; if being run in the terminal, it is automatically set to "__main__". So this is essentially directing the script to execute the commands beneath it when running in the terminal - in this case, askin the user to input a URL to test, and then running that URL through the scan_xss function and printing out the results. #
if __name__ == "__main__":
    url = input("Enter a URL to test for XSS:")
    print(scan_xss(url))

# DONE: When you have finished annotating this script with your own comments, copy it to Web Security Dojo
# DONE: Test this script against one XSS-positive target and one XSS-negative target
# DONE: Paste the outputs here as comments in this script, clearling indicating which is positive detection and negative detection
